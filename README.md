PETA-Bot

Price Edge & Twitter Analysis Bot (PETA-Bot)

This project was started for the chainlink 2021 hackathon as my first foray into ethereum, smart contracts, and chainlink.

The code will contain queries for generating price quotes from different exchanges, including DODO and chainlink data oracles. 

When there is a price advantage, the twitter bot will tweet out the currency pair and the price edge. 

Previous price data and opportunities will be tracked in an interactive dashboard.
